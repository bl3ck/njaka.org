## 10 Websites with resources to help teach your kids how to code 

Coding for kids is the new literacy. It covers various aspects of a kid’s learning; logic building, systematic thinking, problem-solving, teamwork, and creativity. Teaching coding to kids has become an essential part of the curriculum, and through learning to code, kids can improve their problem-solving skills as well as developing computational thinking skills. Kids have probably been exposed to computers, video games, smartphones, tablets, and other electronics from a young age and some of them are savvy enough to have shown interest in developing their own games so kids as young as 7 years of age can start coding and learning the very basics of programming. Coding for kids has gained popularity in recent years as science, innovation and technology has gradually become an increasingly part of everyday life. Kids who learn to code when they’re young can set themselves up for a lifetime of opportunities for success.

Coding in its most basic term is computer programming or developing. Coding utilizes a creative process in which computers are instructed on how to execute different actions.
In this article, we will discuss, early education coding websites that teach the basic concepts of coding like commands that a computer can execute, functions, loops, conditional codes, bug fixing, and variables to kids and young programmers.

So even though the game doesn't teach any specific programming languages, it gives young children these foundations from which they will build on and learn to code. This game will engage young children in computational thinking - the fundamental techniques needed to understand coding - without them realizing they are learning. It will also ignite their passion for puzzles and problem-solving - all while playing a fun game with animals.
