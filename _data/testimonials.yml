  text: Joining Njaka was the best decision I've ever made. I started with zero coding experience, but now I’ve built my own interactive stories and games using Scratch. What I love most is how supportive the coaches are—they always encourage me to think creatively and solve problems on my own. Thanks to Njaka, I’ve discovered a passion for programming, and I can’t wait to see where it takes me!

  text: Before Njaka, I never thought I could design a website—but after just a few months of hands-on workshops, I created a portfolio site for my drawings using HTML and CSS! The real-world projects we work on make learning so much more meaningful. Plus, collaborating with other teens and presenting our projects in the code club has boosted my confidence. Njaka has given me the skills and mindset to pursue a future in tech.

  text: I especially enjoy the coding games and challenges—we get to ‘play’ while learning how real code works! My favorite part is when we brainstorm an idea, plan it with flowcharts, and then make it come alive on the screen. Everyone cheers when a project works, even when it takes many tries. Now I look forward to every session and am dreaming about becoming a software engineer one day, thanks to Njaka!
